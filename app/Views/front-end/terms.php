                <p>By agreeing to these Terms of Service and creating a listing, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence.</p>
                <p>You may not use our platform for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction. You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature. A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your Services.</p>

                    <li><strong>Content Restrictions:</strong> We do NOT allow contact details (like website URLs or email addresses) within non-designated fields (e.g., listing title, business description) unless your subscription plan explicitly permits it. Such information will be removed, or the listing will not be published.</li>

                <h2>SECTION 2 – GENERAL CONDITIONS</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
                <p>You understand that your content (not including credit card information), may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to the technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. Credit card information is always encrypted during transfer over networks.</p>
                <p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the service is provided, without express written permission by us.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 3 – ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS OF MERCHANT INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>Truckers Africa is a platform that connects Drivers and Trucking Companies with Merchants. Much of the material on this site (e.g., business descriptions, opening hours, contact details) is provided by the Merchants who create the listings ("listees").</p>
                <p>While we may perform a basic verification process to approve Merchants for the platform, we are not responsible if the information a Merchant makes available on their profile is not accurate, complete, or current. Any reliance on the material on this site is at your own risk. Drivers are encouraged to verify critical information (like opening hours) directly with the Merchant before traveling.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify the contents of this site at any time, but we have no obligation to update any information on our site. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor changes to our site.</p>

                <p>We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time.</p>
                <p>We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 5 – SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES (FOR MERCHANTS)</h2>
                <p>Our services refer to the subscription plans that allow Merchants to list their business on our platform.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our subscription plans to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. All descriptions of subscription plans or pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>We do not warrant that the quality of any subscription plan, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected.</p>

We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain any comments in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for any comments; or (3) to respond to any comments.</p>
                <p>We may, but have no obligation to, monitor, edit or remove content that we determine in our sole discretion is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>You agree that your comments will not violate any right of any third party, including copyright, trademark, or privacy rights. You further agree that your comments will not contain libelous or otherwise unlawful or abusive material. You may not use a false e-mail address or pretend to be someone other than yourself. You are solely responsible for any comments you make and their accuracy. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any comments posted by you or any third party.</p>
