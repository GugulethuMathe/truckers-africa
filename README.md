##################################################################################################
Objective: Design a modern, intuitive, and mobile-first UI for the main dashboard of the "Truckers Africa" web application. The dashboard is for truck drivers and must be easy to use on the road, with a focus on clarity, readability, and quick access to critical information.

Core Theme & Style:

Style: Clean, modern, and professional.
Layout: A map-centric design should be the primary focus.
Color Palette: Use a high-contrast color scheme suitable for both day and night use. A base of dark greys or blues (#1F2937, #374151) with accents of a vibrant color like blue (#3B82F6) or amber (#F59E0B) for calls-to-action, routes, and important icons.
Typography: Use a clear, legible sans-serif font like Inter or Roboto.
Framework: The design should be implemented using Tailwind CSS.
Key Components & Features:

Main Dashboard View (The Map):
The central element should be a large, interactive map that displays the driver's current location with a distinct pulsating marker.
Overlay the map with icons representing different merchant categories (e.g., a wrench for mechanics, a fuel pump for gas stations, a bed for rest stops). These icons must be clickable.
Include a floating search bar at the top of the screen with the placeholder text "Search for services, e.g., 'tyre repair'".
A prominent "Plan Route" button should be easily accessible.
Route Planning Interface:
When the "Plan Route" button is clicked, a simple form should appear (e.g., in a sidebar or a modal).
The form needs fields for "Start Location," "Destination," and an option to "+ Add Stop" for multi-stop journeys.
Once a route is entered, it should be clearly drawn on the map. The merchants displayed should automatically filter to show only those relevant to the planned route.
Merchant Feed / List View:
This should be a scrollable list, perhaps as a draggable bottom sheet on mobile or a fixed sidebar on larger screens.
Each item in the list is a "Merchant Card" containing:
Merchant Name (bold)
Service Category (e.g., "Border Clearing Agent")
Star Rating (e.g., 4.5 ★) and number of reviews (e.g., "(12 reviews)")
Distance from the driver's current location (e.g., "5.2 km away").
A status indicator (e.g., a green dot for "Open Now").
Merchant Detail Page:
This view appears when a driver taps on a merchant's map icon or list item.
It should include:
A header with the merchant's name and a gallery of photos.
A clear list of "Services Offered."
Contact information with "Click-to-Call" and "Get Directions" buttons.
Detailed opening hours.
A section for user reviews, with a simple form for the driver to leave their own rating and comments.
Driver Profile & Notifications:
An icon (e.g., a user avatar) in the corner should lead to the driver's profile page, where they can see their saved routes and review history.
A non-intrusive toast notification should be designed for rest break reminders. For example: "Time for a break! Tap to see nearby rest stops."
